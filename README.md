# OOP Educational Purpose Examples

This repository contains examples of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts implemented in Java. These examples are designed for beginners and educators to understand and demonstrate OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## Repository Structure

- `LibraryManagementSystem/` - Example of a Library Management System.
- `ECommercePlatform/` - Example of an E-commerce Platform.
- `SchoolManagementSystem/` - Example of a School Management System.

Each folder contains:
1. Source code (`src/`).
2. A dedicated `README.md` explaining the OOP concepts applied in that example.

## Key OOP Concepts

1. **Encapsulation** - Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction through methods.
2. **Inheritance** - Extending classes to promote code reuse.
3. **Polymorphism** - Using a single interface or method name for multiple implementations.
4. **Abstraction** - Simplifying complex systems by modeling relevant details.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above.
- An IDE or text editor for Java (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code).

### Running Examples
1. Navigate to the desired example folder.
2. Compile the `.java` files in the `src/` directory using `javac`.
3. Run the `main` class using `java`.

Example:
```bash
cd LibraryManagementSystem/src
javac *.java
java LibraryManagementSystem
```
